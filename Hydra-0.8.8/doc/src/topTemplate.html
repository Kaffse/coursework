    <h1> <div class="title"> Hydra: a Functional Digital Circuit
    Description Language </div> </h1>

<p> Hydra is a functional language for specifying digital circuits and
  computer architectures.  It uses a functional style to specify
  circuits clearly and concisely.  There are tools to simplify circuit
  description, including black box abstraction, design patterns, and
  tools for specialised circuits such as control algorithms.  Hydra
  provides tools for simulating complex circuits. </p>

<p> A good way to get started is to work through the tutorials below,
  and to look up circuits and functions in the Reference Manual and
  API Documentation as needed </p>
