## Summary of markdown: level 2 header

Smart typesetting handles correctly lexical elements including
quotations, en-dashes, em-dashes, ellipses. Some "text-examples" for
smart---typesetting...to 'see' how this looks.

try some math $x^2$ and $\frac{x+y}{a+b}$ and $\log_2{n}$ and
$\sqrt{b^2 - 4 \times a \times c}$ and $[x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_{n-1}]$

This is an equation using display math, the content of the
equation is nonsense

$$ scanl\ f\ a\ xs\ =\ take\ n\ (reps\ f)\ xs $$

Code is indented 5 spaces

     inv4 [a,b,c,d] = [inv a, inv b, inv c, inv d]

-------- -------- -------------------------
  load    RX      r[d] := mem[q+r[x]] <br>
                  The effective address is calculated.
                  The word at this address is fetched from
                  the memory, and loaded into the destination
                  register.

  add     RRR     r[d] := r[a] + r[b]
                  The two operands are fetched from registers,
                  added, and the sum is loaded into the
                  destination register.

![foldl4 box][foldl4box]

An alternative form is to incorporate the URL to the image file
directly, rather than indirectly via a label.  The URL goes in round
parentheses.

![the same diagram of map4inv](figures/map4inv.png)

At the end is a list of the image labels along with the corresponding
links.
