Firstly I formed a formula for working out the fibanacci sequence, akin to psuedo code. From this I used building blocks (mux for ifs and adders for + etc) to form a circuit design.
It was a simple case of translating this to Hydra and then writing the test data around it.
My solution works correctly, however it doesn't handle overflow. There is no specification for how to handle this so I left it out.
Posible solutions would be feeding the c out of the adder into an OR with the reset value, meaning overflow would reset both x and y to 1 and 0 respectivally.
Other solutions would require more thought and potentially changing the circuit design (for example switching to registers and holding the last value on overflow)
Par this I feel it is a entirely standard and "correct" solution.
For testing I reset the circut, let it run for a while (reset = 0) to ensure the sequence was correct, then reset again to ensure it worked correctly.
